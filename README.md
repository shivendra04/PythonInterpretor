# Online Python Interpreter

This is a simple web application that allows users to write, edit, and execute Python code in an interactive environment. The application features a rich text editor for the problem statement, syntax-highlighted Python code editor, and a server-side execution environment for running Python scripts.

## Features

- **Interactive Problem Statement**: Users can write problem statements with rich text formatting (bold, italics, bullet points, and more) using **Quill.js**.
- **Python Code Editor**: The application includes a code editor powered by **CodeMirror** with Python syntax highlighting and smart indentation.
- **Code Execution**: Python code is executed on the server, and the result is returned and displayed on the frontend.
- **Persistence**: Both the problem statement and the Python code are stored in the browser's **localStorage**, ensuring that they persist across page refreshes.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure and styling.
  - **JavaScript**: Handles frontend logic for the editor and code execution.
  - **Quill.js**: Used for the rich text problem statement editor.
  - **CodeMirror**: A flexible code editor used for writing Python code with syntax highlighting.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Python (Flask)**: A lightweight web framework that handles code execution on the server side.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PythonInterpreter.git
cd PythonInterpreter
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

Make sure to create a virtual environment to isolate your Python environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the application

To run the Flask application locally, execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 4. Frontend Setup

The frontend uses static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once the backend is running, you can open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Problem Statement**: Use the rich text editor (Quill.js) at the top of the page to write the problem statement. You can format the statement using **bold**, *italic*, `underline`, and create **bullet points** or **ordered lists**.
   
2. **Python Code**: Write Python code in the **CodeMirror** editor. The editor will provide syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and bracket matching.

3. **Execute Python Code**: Click the **Run Code** button to send the Python code to the backend for execution. The output (or error message) will be displayed below the editor.

4. **Persistence**: The problem statement and Python code are saved in your browserâ€™s `localStorage`. So, even if you refresh the page, your code and problem statement will persist.

## Example

### Problem Statement:

**Input**:

You are given a number `n`. Print all the numbers from `1` to `n` using recursion.

**Output**:

For an input `n = 5`, the program should output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```
